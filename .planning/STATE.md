# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-05)

**Core value:** GeoHist Trivia players and Play reviewers reach an authoritative, accessible page — featuring the app, hosting its privacy policy, and offering a working contact channel — before the app goes live on Google Play.
**Current focus:** Phase 06 — Changelog Page

## Current Position

Phase: 06 (Changelog Page) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3 — all plans executed
Status: Phase 06 execution complete (verifier/ship pending)
Last activity: 2026-09-06 — 06-03 gap closure executed (G-06-9 resolved)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (lifetime — v1 shipped 12 plans / 30 tasks in 4 days):**

- Total plans completed: 12 (v1)
- v2.0 plans completed: 0

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Locked] Dictionary-swap single-URL i18n architecture — no per-language subdirs/hreflang (anti-pattern at this shape; revisit only with crawlability case)
- [Locked] Consent = load-gating; fork-shaped Firebase split (analytics only in consent.js; auth+firestore only in contact.js) — App Check must ride contact.js submit path, never page load
- [Locked] Changelog: keyed chrome, EN entries (documented i18n exception); changelog keys land in es/pt-BR atomically with the page, BEFORE ×20 expansion
- [Locked] No CNAME file under Actions publishing — domain lives in repo Settings; cert verified BEFORE URL rewrite; console allowlists BEFORE rewrite
- [Locked] aggregateRating JSON-LD permanently OFF unless an on-site review source exists (Google review-snippet policy bars mirroring Play ratings)
- [v1] Firestore console ruleset is NOT byte-identical to repo `firebase/firestore.rules` — future rules edits require console re-paste
- [v1] Canonical measurementId G-KDWVVHRYD5; site copy refers to Santiago David Postorivo (internal `persano.*` identifiers unchanged)
- [Phase 06]: Changelog chrome keyed changelog.* mirroring guide.html 1:1; entry content stays EN-unkeyed (documented i18n exception)
- [Phase 06]: Fixed vacuous validate:links — linkinator 8.1.0 treats the ^https?:// lookahead skip as match-nothing (0 links scanned); replaced with plain-string skips, live self-URL checks live in smoke-check.sh
- [Phase 06]: Key surface 146→169 moved atomically (page + 3 nav/footer inserts + 2 dictionaries + keycheck registration, one commit); red gate proven both directions locally
- [Phase 06]: Curated 6 of 13 real 0.x versions for changelog backfill (0.88/0.87/0.84/0.8/0.7/0.2) telling the arc; git-mined dates authoritative (0.2 -> 2026-08-24, 0.88 -> 2026-09-04); pre-scheme 3.0-10.0 era excluded — D-02 curation over commit-log dump; D-08 honesty - dates match versionName-touching commits, cross-checkable against Play history
- [Phase 06]: [Phase 06] G-06-9 resolved per owner D-notice: Notice only — keyed changelog notice (170-key atomic surface move) + static EN-ES-PT line on scriptless privacy.html (06-01 D-13 stands, no dead-key swap); browser-native translation remains the mechanism; deploy push gate unblocked

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Custom domain name + apex-vs-www choice undecided — owner decision at Phase 8 planning
- reCAPTCHA provider (v3 vs Enterprise) hinges on Cloud Billing willingness — owner decision, first task of Phase 9
- Per-language register table needs a one-time owner pass before dictionary drafting (e.g., de du vs Sie)
- zh variant confirmation (Simplified-only?) — check app repo `strings.xml` (`values-zh-rCN`?) before locking
- App Check enforcement threshold (N successful submissions + token-failure %) to be agreed with owner in Phase 9
- Play Console privacy-URL field still owner-pending before Play submission (v1 carryover); Play listing live date gates SEO-06 flip
- Urdu Nastaliq rendering quality needs real-device visual verification (documented degradation acceptable, silent discovery is not)
